# Classifications


* logistic regression: an ML method used for categorical (0-1) classifications
* k-fold: horizontal slices of data
* Data-slicing: vertical slices of data
* F1 score: a common metric for measuring classification accuracy (higher scores are better).
* reshape(): a method for changing the shape of data to prepare it for ML predictions.
* r-squared: a metric used to measure model performance for regressions (between 0 and 1, the higher the better)
* sum of squared errors (SSE): a metric used to measure model performance for regressions: (0 or higher, the lower the better)

# Testing

* r-squared: a metric used to measure model performance for regressions (between 0 and 1, the higher the better)
* sum of squared errors (SSE): a metric used to measure model performance for regressions: (0 or higher, the lower the better)
* raw comparison test: a test for model drift that consists of checking whether a new model score is worse than all previous scores
* parametric significance test: a test model drift that consists of checking whether a new model score is more than 2 standard deviations worse than the mean of all previous scores
* non-parametric outlier test: a test for model drift that consists of checking whether a new score is more than 1.5 interquartile ranges worse than the 25th or 75th percentile of previous scores
* standard deviation: a measure of how far spread apart the observations in a dataset are
* interquartile range: the difference between the 75th percentile and the 25th percentile of a set of observat
* p-value: a numerical result from a t-test used to determine whether two sets of numbers differ
* t-test: a statistical test for comparing two sets of numbers
* statistical significance: a concept describing the degree of evidence that two sets differ
